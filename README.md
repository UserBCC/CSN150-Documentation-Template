## Steps I followed
1. Arduino 1.8.19 was installed.
2. An account was made for OpenWeather for API keys.
3. A source code was imorted for the ESP32 to connect.
4. Wifi name and password was provided to the code.
5. Ensure that the computers vpn is off and be in close proximity to the router.

## Problems
There were about three ways to create the weather station, but I was only able to do one of the three options. 2 of the three methods required putting together sensors and cables on a board using a wiring diagram. In the end I managed to get the weather and temperature without a complicated setup.
